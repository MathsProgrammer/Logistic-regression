This section is a sample code of how to use logistic regression in python. The data attatched is about exam results across writing, reading and maths tests at a school (sourcec on kaggle). Logistic regression is performed to test whether it is possible to predict the students gender based on features: results, parents education level, race, school lunch type and test preparation. The model found that 97.8% of students genders could be predicted correctly just some from these features.
