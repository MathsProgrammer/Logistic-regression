This section is a sample code of how to use logistic regression in python. The data attatched is about exam results across writing, reading and maths tests at a school (sourcec on kaggle). A logistic regression is performed to test whether it is possible to predict the students gender based on their results, parents education level, race, school lunch type and test preparation. The model found that 97.8% of students genders were predicted correctly.
